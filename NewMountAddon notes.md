# New Mount Addon

I want a 'random mount' summoner, that isn't totally random.  I want it to be 'smart', knowing where I am, where mounts come from, and a sense of the story & role play of the place.  There are a lot of mounts out there, I don't have half of them, so I think a 'crowdsourced' interface will work best for coming up with the lists & preferences etc, this will require a website portion to the addon.

## Naming

I want a fun name to the addon.  Some brainstorming so far has come up with 'Livery' or 'Wrangler' as a basis, maybe the name of someone who works in the Livery?  Not a Ferrier as that is horse shoeing... but something along those lines.

## Similar Addons

I took a look through the [Companions](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/companions) section of Curseforge and found some other addons that have some similarities to what I'm thinking of doing.

* (Collect Me)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/collect_me] - 9 years old, 2.6million downloads, well maintained, incorporates pets & titles and things too.  MIT.
* (Litemount)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/litemount] - 7 years old, 250k downloads, lots of manual setup, needs work for 8.0 atm. GNU.
* (Mount Journal Enhanced)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/mount-journal-enhanced] - 4 years old, 80k downloads, Mostly just updating the Mount Journal itself to add filters and things to it. GNU.
* (GoGoMount)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/gogomount] - 10 years old, 1.1million downloads, private license.
* (Livestock)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/livestock] - 10 years old, 200k downloads, All Rights Reserved.  I like the name, similar ideas re zones and stuff from the descriptions.
* (Bestride)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/bestride-mm] - New, 1.5k downloads, GNU.  Continuation of Yay Mounts. Nothing fancy?
* (Choose Mount)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/choose-mount] - 5 years old, 4k downloads, GNU. Pretty simple.
* (Intellimount)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/intellimount] - 4 years old, 6k downloads, All Rights Reserved. Out of date.  Nothing fancy.
* (Let's Ride!)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/lets-ride] - 2 years old, 1k downloads, GNU, Out of date.  Like the name, has a bit of weighting to the randomness.  
* (gmMounts)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/mrc] - 6 years old, 1.8k downloads, BSD, Out of date.  He wants you to edit the LUA to make your categories of mounts.  Seems like these people who make a macro listing their mounts, it is targeted at them.
* (MyLilPony)[https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/mylilpony] - 7 years old, 3.3k downloads, out of date, BSD. Haha, great name.  Pretty nerdy.

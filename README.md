*Go Go Inspector Gadgetzan!*

## Overview

With Inspector Gadgetzan, when you inspect another player you get a new tab along the bottom: IG.  Viewing this tab will show you all the appearances that person is using for their current look.  From here you can control-click the items to see how it would look on you, you can look at their tooltips to get extra information (typically from other addons), and you can click its name to view that appearance in the wardrobe collection.

Additionally if the person you are inspecting is mounted, it will show you the name of their current mount, and give you a button to see that mount in the mount journal.

## Slash commands

Inspector Gadgetzan gives you a few slash commands to use as well to help with your macros etc.

* `/ig mount`  - this will report to you the current target's mount both in chat and pop the mount journal for that mount
* `/ig mount clone` - this is a fun quick gadget that lets you mount the same mount as your target (if you have it of course)
* `/ig inspect` - inspect the target and jump to the Inspect Gadgetzan tab directly*
